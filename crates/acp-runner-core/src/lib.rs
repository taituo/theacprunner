//! Provider-neutral domain model for acp-runner.
//!
//! This crate deliberately has no I/O. It defines:
//!
//! * the resolved run/runner-class specifications the engine works with ([`spec`]),
//! * the per-attempt document handed to `runnerd` inside the sandbox ([`attempt_spec`]),
//! * the durable agent-execution-environment primitive ([`environment`]),
//! * explicit state machines for runs and attempts ([`state`]),
//! * failure classification and the retry/fallback planner ([`failure`], [`plan`]),
//! * the append-only event model ([`events`]),
//! * the provider-neutral resume capsule used for retries and fallbacks ([`capsule`]),
//! * provider credential whitelists and bundle validation ([`credentials`]),
//! * secret redaction ([`redact`]) and path safety helpers ([`paths`]),
//! * signed environment connection tickets ([`ticket`]).
//!
//! Nothing in here knows how a particular CLI is installed or started; that lives in
//! `acp-runner-drivers`.
